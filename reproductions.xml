<h1>Ordering Reproductions</h1>	

<p>As part of our service to readers, the Special Collections Research
Center provides photocopies from books and manuscripts in the
collections for your research use. These copies are provided in
accordance with the United States copyright law. Copying is limited to
materials in sound physical condition and not subject to legal or donor
restrictions. All requests for copies are subject to curatorial
approval.</p>

<p>Permission to copy does not convey the right to reproduce or publish the
material. Readers must submit written requests for permission to
reproduce or publish material from the collections. Some publication
projects may be subject to a use fee.</p>
