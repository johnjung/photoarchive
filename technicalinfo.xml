<h1>Technical Information</h1>

<p>Photographic materials, including prints, lantern slides, glass plate
negatives, and transparencies, are scanned on flatbed scanners equipped
with transparency units. Production master files are captured at 400, 600,
or 1200 ppi, depending on color, condition, and medium, and are saved and
stored as uncompressed Tiffs. All monitors and scanners are calibrated
utilizing the Monaco EZ Color System. Software employed in post-capture
processing consists of Adobe Photoshop (ver. 9), and Equilibrium
Debabelizer (ver.5) with which JPEG derivatives for Web display are batch-
produced.</p>

<p>Descriptive metadata records are created according to the University of
Chicago Library Guidelines for use of the Dublin Core element set (DCMI) in
Library digitization projects. The controlled vocabulary terms of each
record are drawn from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus, the Library
of Congress Name Authority File, the Library of Congress Subject Headings,
the United States Geographical Survey, and the Getty Thesaurus of
Geographic Names.</p>

<p>The Campus Grid Location designation in descriptive records is an
alphanumeric identifier which references  the position of Buildings and
Ground features on the University's Master Grid Map. For buildings and
ground features, which have been demolished, the Photofiles team assigned
identifiers to which an "H" was added to denote historical status.
Additionally, identifiers were fashioned for existing ground features that
had no previous grid number assignments.</p>
