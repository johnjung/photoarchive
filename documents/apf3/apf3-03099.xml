  <description>Using a chart and Springfield rifle of World War I vintage, chief instructor Russell Wiles Jr. explains the mechanism and care of weapons. Wooden gun experts! Training with wooden guns, riflemen are being turned out on a mass production basis at the field house of the University of Chicago! Students are mainly men who plan to enter armed forces and seek basic military training&hellip;in easy doses. Only 100 rounds of ammunition are used during the entire course and 40 of these cartridges are shot during the final exam. They get so much practice with a wooden gun that when they actually get their hands on a rifle they score in the expert class.</description>
