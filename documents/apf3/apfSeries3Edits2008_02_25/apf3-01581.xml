  <description>Section of a triangular-shaped and grooved foot race starting gate pavement from a stadium near the Temple of Poseidon at Corinth. The stadium (dated to 400 B.C.E.) in which the Isthmian Games were held contains the pavement with a pit for the races' starter at its apex. Waist-high crossbars were hinged to upright posts and raised and lowered by cords, which ran through grooves to the starter in the pit. Excavated by a University of Chicago expedition led by Oscar Broneer.</description>
