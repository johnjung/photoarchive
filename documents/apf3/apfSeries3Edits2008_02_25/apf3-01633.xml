  <description>[Professor Henri Frankfort and members of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute Iraq expedition excavated these Sumerian statues,] which will be exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair. [The pieces were found at Tell Asmar and Khafeje (Diy&#257;l&#257; river valley, east central Iraq). Four had been buried under the floor of the god Abu's shrine at Tell Asmar when it was renovated between 3,000 and 2,800 B.C.E. The largest figure (30 inches high) is from Khafaje and also was excavated in a shrine precinct.]</description>
