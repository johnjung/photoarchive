  <description>[Professor Oscar Broneer oversees a re-enactment of the start of a foot race, using a starting gate set up at a stadium near the Temple of Poseidon at Corinth. The stadium (dated to 400 B.C.E.) in which the Isthmian Games were held contains a triangular-shaped pavement with a pit for the races' starter at its apex which has been excavated by a University of Chicago expedition led by Broneer. The starter controlled the gates with cords, which ran through patterned grooves.]</description>
