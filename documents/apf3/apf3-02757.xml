  <description>Taken in front of the headquarters of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia in the Hotel D&rsquo; Europe, Petrograd, the photograph includes: Lieutenant-Colonel Frank Billings, M.D. (head of the mission); Samuel Harper (University of Chicago Class of 1901); Major Harold H. Swift (University of Chicago Class of 1907); and Major Wilbur F. Post (University of Chicago Class of 1901). Harper was the general American man-of-all-work in Petrograd, his knowledge of Russian affairs and the Russian language and his wide acquaintance among the Russians giving him an extraordinary opportunity for service. The other three were members of the American Mission. Dr. Billings, as head of Rush Medical College, and in connection with the collection of funds for the new medical school at the university, is too widely known to need comment. Harold Swift is a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Chicago. Harper is an assistant professor of Russian language at that institution. All four returned to the United States in October. It is unquestionable that the indirect influence of the university in Russia recently has been greater than that of any other American institution.</description>
