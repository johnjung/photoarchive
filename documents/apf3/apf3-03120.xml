  <description>College campus in wartime. Chicago, Illinois. Typical of the change of the war has made on the physical aspect of the college campus, are this and the accompanying scenes photographed at the University of Chicago. A Navy ensign, an Army officer and two non-commissioned students of the Meteorology School stroll with co-eds along one of the many picturesque quadrangle paths. The University, like practically every large school, has altered its curriculum to aid in developing skilled technicians for the war effort, and, like many other universities, has service men residing on the campus while they are trained in special courses needed for Army and Navy duties. Its stately Gothic buildings now house several hundred men of all classifications.</description>
