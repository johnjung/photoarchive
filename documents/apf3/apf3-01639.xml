  <description>Jarmo (Iraq), one of the world's oldest known agricultural communities, was first excavated in 1948 by a team from the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute led by Robert J. Braidwood. Pictures of Jarmo [and adjacent settlements] from his 1950-1951 expedition, top row: (1) About the size of a small city block, Jarmo (near Kirkuk) dates to 4750 B.C.E; (2) Approximately 300 inhabitants once lived in 50 mud-walled houses, each containing ovens complete with chimneys, and several rectilinear rooms. The picture shows reeds used as flooring. Bottom row: (1) Stone floorings and clusters of hearth stones at Karim Shahir, a two-acre site upstream from Jarmo, that was excavated by the American Schools of Oriental Research. (2) Stone-age Palegawra, a cave near Sulimaniyah, ten miles east of Jarmo, [thought to have been] occupied by hunter-gatherers.</description>
