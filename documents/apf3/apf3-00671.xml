  <description>Rhein-Main Airport, April 5, 1948. The arrival of this four-motored Constellation Flagship at the airport marked the sixteenth thousandth transatlantic crossing of an American Overseas Airlines Flagship since the inauguration of transatlantic service in 1942. Coinciding with this event, the first group of University of Chicago faculty arrived as passengers to lecture as exchange professors at the University of Frankfurt. Second row, left to right: Elder Olson (contemporary American poetry); Paul A. Weiss (biology); Everett Hughes (sociology); and Henry A. Wann (Director of Education and Cultural Relations OMG, Hesse). First row: Kurt A. Felix (Pro-Rector, University of Frankfurt); Wilhelm Pauck (theology); Roger Oake (tour organizer); Thelma and Louis Thurstone (psychology); and Howard Becker (Chief of Higher Education Branch, OMG Hesse). Professor Felix, Mr. Wann and Dr. Becker were among many at the airport to greet the faculty who will stay in Germany for one semester. This is the first exchange of professors between the United States and Germany since the War.</description>
