  <description>View of the picnic on Stagg Field, Alumni Day Saturday, June 11. Ceremonies have just ended and the crowd is scattered about with basket lunches. Some of the class umbrellas can be seen. The Shanty stands to the right; in the distance, at the left, the Carnival and the Circus tents can be noted. At this moment, an airplane dropping souvenir American flags was passing over the field. The picnic, which closed the Alumni part of the reunion program, was one of the most successful features. If you missed it, well, come home next year!</description>
