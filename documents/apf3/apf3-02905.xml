  <description>Weddings are also a part of the duties of the workers at the Midway U.S.O. Recently the center made arrangements for the weeding of Harry L. Church of Brewer, Me., and Thelma Adele Emery of Orrington, Me. Following the ceremony, which was performed by Dean Charles W. Gilkey of the University of Chicago chapel, a reception was given to the couple at the Gilkey home, with Mrs. Gilkey and members of the U.S.O. as hostesses.</description>
