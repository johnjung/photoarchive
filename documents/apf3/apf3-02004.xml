  <description>Harold Swift, Class of 1907 president (left), Helen Norris, Class of 1907 Reunion Committee co-chairman who also acted as the Dean (center), and President Harry Pratt Judson (right), standing on the 1907 prize-wining birthday cake float, which served as a platform. The Class of 1907 was the first to graduate under the presidency of Dr. Judson, and, in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Class and of the Prexy's service, a beautiful diploma, an honorary degree of affection and esteem, was conferred upon him. This clever ceremony was one of the best features of Alumni Day, and shows how that day can be made more and more interesting by unique class stunts. Prexy, the Class, and the audience enjoyed the ceremony immensely.</description>
