  <description>Temple of En-lil, city of Nippur in Iraq, excavated by a joint expedition of University of Chicago and University of Pennsylvania archeologists. A series of building programs is revealed in the stratification of the site. A team member stands on the earliest temple's floor built ca. 2200 B.C.E. under which the remains of fire pits have been discovered. His head is even with the top of the first temple's fragmentary walls, and the bottom of the second temple's walls erected one hundred years later. A third set of walls rise above the step back, and were built by 14th century B.C.E. kings who destroyed all but a few traces of an intervening temple. At the top of these are large foundation bricks of a citadel, built after 200 B.C.E. All the bricks are of sun-dried mud or adobe.</description>
