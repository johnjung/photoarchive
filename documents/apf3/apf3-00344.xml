  <description>Speaker at the March 15th meeting of the University of Chicago Citizens Board. Dr. James Rowland Angell, distinguished educator, whose vast expertise will soon be applied in the educational and cultural interests of millions of radio listeners in the role of Educational Counselor of the National Broadcasting Company. Following the announcement of his intended retirement after 16 years of distinguished service as president of Yale University, Dr. Angell was prevailed upon by Lenox R. Lohr, president of National Broadcasting Company, to accept a post with NBC. In accepting the offer Dr. Angell declared: The educational possibilities of radio are just beginning to be fully appreciated and I trust that I can make some small contribution to increasing its significance for young and old alike.</description>
