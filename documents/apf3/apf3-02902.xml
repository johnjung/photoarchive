  <description>Let's go to the USO. [The Midway USO was the outgrowth of an effort between residents of Hyde Park and Woodlawn and the University of Chicago community to create a program of activities designed to promote good will, entertainment, and services for the increasing number of army and naval recruits, post-Pearl Harbor. Originally called the Midway Service Organization, it soon was incorporated into the USO and given headquarters at the old St. Paul&rsquo;s Church on Dorchester Avenue. In July of 1942, the University of Chicago donated the Frost Mansion, a building acquired by the University to be used as a fraternity house and art center and located at 975 E. 60th Street to be the new locale for USO clubhouse on campus. Naval officers and sailors in the photograph are shown here.]</description>
