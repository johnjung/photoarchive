  <description>Jarmo (Iraq), site of a University of Chicago Oriental Institute's archeological expedition, contains approximately 15 levels. Portable pottery is present in the uppermost third; the lower two-thirds of the deposit represents a pre-ceramic stage. Top row: (1) Example of a stone vessel found in one of the lower levels. (2) Baked-in-place clay floor basin in which inhabitants cooked. Floor basins, used [before the advent] of portable pottery, were made smooth by wetting the sides and rubbing them with a stone. Bottom rowt: (1) Decorated pottery example, [possibly imported]. (2) Undecorated pottery made by the inhabitants of Jarmo, a coarser [variety] than the decorated piece.</description>
