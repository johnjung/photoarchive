  <description>A unique program of study at an American evening college by a foreign student is rewarded with a presentation of a special certificate by Dean Maurice F. X. Donahue (left) of the University College, the University of Chicago. Receiving the award for completion of a year of graduate study in educational administration is Yehuda Messinger, 42, of Israel. Mr. Messinger is Dean of the State Teachers College for Kibbutz Education near Tel Aviv, Israel. Given a year's grant for foreign study before taking over his deanship, Mr. Messinger chose the Midwest and an evening college. Much of his work is concerned with the administration of adult education. His school trains teachers for work on Israel's well-known cooperative agricultural settlements.</description>
