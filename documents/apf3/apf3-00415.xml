  <description>Photograph of the University&rsquo;s seventh convocation, July 1, 1894, shows the first convocation held outside. The buildings on the right are Goodspeed and Gates-Blake Halls, which were then known as South and Middle Divinity and Graduate (later North) halls. The Midway Plaisance is in the background. The speaker is Albert A. Michelson, Head Professor of Physics, and the first American to win the Nobel Prize in Science. His speech, Some the Objects and Methods of Physical Science must have been well received by at least two members of the audience: Henry Gordon Gale, who received his Academic College Certificate on this day, and who later became a close associate of Michelson&rsquo;s and chairman of the Department of Physics; and Frank R. Lillie, who received his Doctor of Philosophy at this convocation, and who later became Dean of the Biological Sciences at the University of Chicago. On the platform, third from the left in the first row is President William Rainey Harper. In the second row, the first person on the left is Martin A. Ryerson, the president of the Board of Trustees, and the sixth person is John Dewey, the philosopher and educator.  Also shown are William G. Hale, J. Laurence Laughlin, George C. Walker, and Silas Cobb. This is a gift of Mrs. C. Philip Miller.</description>
