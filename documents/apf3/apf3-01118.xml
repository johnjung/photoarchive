  <description>From 1891 to 1941, these were the latest spring styles. In 1891, just fifty years ago, co-eds were scarce on the new University of Chicago campus, but here and there, a faculty wife (or daughter) wore puffed sleeves, bustles, and plumed hats. Fifty years later in 1941, there are co-eds a plenty, and here's what they'll wear this spring, according to the Style Creators of Chicago. The models are members of the 16th annual Mirror Revue, February 27, 28, and March 1 at Mandel Hall, which will celebrate the university's 50th Anniversary, hence the 50-year cycle in costumes. Models, left to right): Shirlee Smith in a red twill military coat with blouse back; Jeanne Groenier modeling a beige three piece cereal tweed spectator suit with full lynx tuxedo collar; Barbara Foote wearing a flannel torso jacket of turf brown over a reverse print dress; and Marilyn Robb in a casual two-piece suit with pleated skirt of lime and ore plaid. Frances Farwell and Kathleen (center in Gay Nineties dress with puffed sleeves, bustles, plumed hats, and parasols.</description>
