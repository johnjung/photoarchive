  <description>Babylonian bird goddess at prayer before a divinity (broken section of plaque) is one of the discoveries of the joint archeological expedition of the University of Chicago and University of Pennsylvania at the city of Nippur in Iraq. An example of the artistic achievement of the first dynasty (late 18th century B.C.E.), the taloned goddess is pictured on a mold-made plaque of baked clay, her wings and horned headdress painted a rich red.
