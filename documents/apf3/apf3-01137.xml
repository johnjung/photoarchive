  <description>On the night before an operation, where a patient will have local, spinal, or regional anesthesia, the anesthesiologist asks the patient about a choice of music to listen to during the operation. Patients have the choice of classical, semi-classical, or popular music as an adjuvant to their anesthesia. Surgeons and psychiatrists understand that a surgical operation is a very real ordeal for nearly all patients. [Only the patient can hear the music during the procedure].</description>
