  <description>Entering the college at Chicago U. for the first time are (left to right, sitting) Virginia Kraus, Marc Galanter and Esther Millman. Esther is 16, from Washington, D.C., and had three years of high school and must take only 9 comps. Standing is Leslie Jensen, 17, from Hot Springs, S. Dakota who had 3 years of high school. He was excused from all except 6 comps, and he should be able to finish his requirements for a bachelor's degree in a year and half. He plans to go into the law. Next to him, in bobbed hair and a short jacket is Ellen Jacobs, 15, from Western Springs, Illinois. She's entered after 2 years high school, has 11 comps to take. The tall girl next to her is Dorothea Elmer, 16, of Flint, Michigan who's also entering with only 2 years of high school. Dorothea will take 14 comps. That's the Law School behind them.</description>
