  <description>Audio engineer of music for surgery sets the musical programs for the day. The control room had been designed so that the duonetic tape recorders are self-operating once they have been set for the day. Each recorder, utilizing two recording channels on a 4,800-foot reel of standard one-quarter inch magnetic tape, plays four hours before repeating the program. At the conclusion of two hour&rsquo;s playing, a solenoid switch automatically reverses the direction of the tape and places the lower channel in operation.</description>
