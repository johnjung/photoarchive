  <description>&quot;This large group is the 1913 graduating class of University High School in Scammon Gardens near Belfield Hall. Albert Pick Jr. is the one with his hands cupped around his face. He was probably trying to say something while I [Alan D. Whitney] was taking the picture. Also in the print is Jim Becker of A. G. Becker &amp; Co., Bob Byfield, and Frederick Kuh, the famous correspondent. Kuh is third from the left end, sitting in the second or third row, his head showing in full and his shoulders making a V between the two boys in front of him.&quot;</description>
