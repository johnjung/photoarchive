  <description>Statue of the 18th dynasty Egyptian King Tutankhamen is exhibited at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute. It was found in the debris of a mortuary temple built by the kings Ay and Harmhab near Luxor, which stood north of Ramses III's temple of Medinet Habu. Tutankhamen's portrait statue, standing 17 feet high and weighing over 7 tons, is one of two statues discovered by the Architectural Survey of the Oriental Institute under Dr. Uvo Holscher's directorship. A companion statue is on exhibit in the Cairo Museum in Egypt, and both it and the Chicago piece bear cartouches with the name of Ay (defaced) Tutankhamen's successor, and the next king Harmhab. Later generations used the temple as a stone quarry, and in so doing mutilated the statues.</description>
