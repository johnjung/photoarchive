  <description>Two of the new students entering the College this year sit on a bench in front of the Law School. Pretty, blonde Virginia Kraus, 16, enters after two years of high school. She'll take 14 comprehensives but should still finish two years ahead of her former classmates who'll not enter other colleges for another two years yet. She plans to study dress designing when she finishes her liberal arts education. Next to her is Marc Galanter, 17, of Philadelphia (Virginia's home is in Chicago) who's had 3 1/2 years of high school. He wants to be a psychologist, as a result of his placement tests, he need only take 8 comprehensives.</description>
