  <description>[Photographic copy of a drawing] of a central dining room in the University of Chicago's new $3,200,000 Residence Quadrangle for women. The dining hall, which will seat 400 at one time, is designed in the shape of a cross, with kitchens in the north arm and the food-service unit in the center. Service will be cafeteria style. The ground floor of the central entrance and dining building will contain a general reception room for visitors, and will provide the only access to the three residence halls facing the central court. On the east side of the central entrance hall, a driveway will connect with the street to give sheltered entry in bad weather. The quadrangle, to be built of Indiana limestone, was designed by Eero Saarinen and Associates. Construction is expected to be completed by September 1957 for the opening of the University&rsquo;s autumn quarter.</description>
