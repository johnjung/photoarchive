  <description>This diagram shows how high energy protons are produced and used at the Zero Gradient Synchrotron. Beginning at the top of the diagram, hydrogen atoms are  stripped of their electrons in the ion source, and the resulting protons are accelerated to 750,000 electron volts in the Cockcroft-Walton generator. They are further accelerated to 50 million electron volts (MeV) by the linear accelerator (linac). They are then injected into the magnet ring of the synchrotron, where they are accelerated to 12.5 BeV in a clockwise direction. Each time the protons complete a circuit of the ring they receive a small increase in energy as they pass through the radio frequency accelerating cavity in the ring. It takes only one second to accelerate the protons from 50 MeV to 12.5 BeV as they travel around the 600-foot synchrotron ring. After being accelerated, they can be made to strike targets within the ring to produce secondary particles-mesons, hyperons, anti-particles, etc.-or they can be extracted from the synchrotron at either or both of two points. A 12-foot thick steel wall between the synchrotron ring and the meson experimental area shields against intense radiations from the machine. The presence of this wall, however, means that experimentalists cannot get close enough to the machine in this area to study very short-lived particles. The external beams will be used for this purpose. At this time only one experimental area has been provided for an external beam, although provision is made for extracting the beam at two places. A tunnel exists to bring the beam to a future second proton area.</description>
