  <description>The main switchboard controls the intricate movements of the 82-inch McDonald Observatory telescope and the dome. The complicated control system consists of thirty motors and 5.5 miles of electric wiring. Both the observatory, in the Davis Mountains of Western Texas, and its 82-inch reflecting telescope, the second largest in the world, were designed and built by the Warner and Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio for the University of Texas which will operate the facility with the University of Chicago. The observatory will be dedicated May 5, 1939.</description>
