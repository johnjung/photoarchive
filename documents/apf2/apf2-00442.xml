  <description>Aerial view of the site of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) at Argonne National Laboratory, taken September 26, 1963. A mound of earth, approximately 50 feet high, covers the doughnut-shaped magnet ring building, which is 212 feet in diameter. Inside the building, within a 200-foot ring of steel magnets weighing a total of 4,800 tons, protons-the nuclei of hydrogen atoms-are accelerated to 12.5 billion electron volts. The protons and beams of secondary particles are shot into equipment in experimental buildings at the right. Behind the road leading to the top of the mound at the left is the High Energy Physics building and buildings [that] house the beam injector and control systems of the ZGS.</description>
