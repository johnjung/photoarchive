  <description>Building design model by architect Eero Saarinen for the proposed Law School of the University of Chicago. The Ford Foundation has provided an $800,000 grant (announced January 17, 1956) as part of the estimated $3,500,000 cost. A five-story central structure will face a reflecting pool and house the library, faculty offices, a student lounge, and public rooms. The hexagonal structure at the lower left will accommodate a 600-seat auditorium and a large courtroom for moot trials. Class and seminar rooms will be situated in a two-story wing to the right of the auditorium. A wing (upper right) containing administrative and legal aid office space will connect the library building and Burton-Judson Courts residence hall where law students will live.</description>
