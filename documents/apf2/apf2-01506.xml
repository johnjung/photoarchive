  <description>Chicago Lying-In Hospital at the University of Chicago has constructed a controlled climate room for the therapeutic treatment of patients with toxemias of pregnancy or pre-Eclampsia, one of the two greatest threats to safe childbirth. The climate room varies in temperature from the cool crisp 50s to the dripping heat of the tropics because weather is believed to play an important role in the onset of Eclampsia. Dr. William J. Dieckman, chief of staff and head of Eclampsia research, visits with his patients on morning rounds. Decorated in pink, the climate room measures 16 by 22 feet; an adjacent blue tiled bath opens from the door at left.</description>
