  <description>Southwest corner, fire-gutted building has one and two-rooms kitchenette apartments with an average of six families sharing a toilet. Nine persons lost their lives December 9 in an exceptionally fast spreading fire, which started on the fourth floor but burned out the interior of the rooms, including the ground floor stores. This was the first 5-11 alarm fire Chicago has had in a residential building.</description>
