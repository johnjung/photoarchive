  <description>Rockefeller Memorial Chapel of the University of Chicago is an excellent illustration of Gothic architecture. But the excellence of its architecture is merely a means to the great purpose of the structure. The Chapel stands here to symbolize the ideal of the University. In presenting his final gift of $10,000,000 to the University, John D. Rockefeller, the founder, directed that the amount of $1,500,000 should be devoted to a chapel, which should be dominant in its architecture, and may proclaim that the University in its ideal is dominated by the spirit of religion. The architect was Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue of New York.</description>
