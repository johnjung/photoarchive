  <description>[Photographic copy of a drawing of the] proposed Law School of the University of Chicago by architect Eero Saarinen. Cost of the buildings is estimated at $3,500,000. A five-story central structure will face the reflecting pool and house the library, with stacks, faculty offices, student lounge, and public rooms. The hexagonal facility at the lower left will accommodate a 600-seat auditorium and a large courtroom for moot trials. Class and seminar rooms will be situated in a two-story wing to the right of the auditorium. A wing (upper right) containing administrative and legal aid office space will also connect the library building and Burton-Judson Courts residence hall where law students will be housed.</description>
