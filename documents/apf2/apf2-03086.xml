Jackson created a twelve-foot long Midway perspective [drawing] of the proposed [University of Chicago] library for Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge.

  <noteGeneral>From two notes included with the photo and dating from August 2, 1945 and July 1946: The perspective laid out by Mr. Emery B. Jackson, in the office of Shipley, Rutan and Coolidge was about 12 feet long and was executed about 1910.  It was then sent to England for rendering.  In 1930, the original image drawing was damaged by fire and water while in the care of Charles Hodgdon and Sons, Architects. This firm kept it in the third floor of an uncompleted building.
