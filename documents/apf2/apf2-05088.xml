  <description>A technician grinds and polishes the 82-inch reflecting mirror for the McDonald Observatory telescope. The cutting tool used weighed 2,300 lbs. The process of accurately finishing the mirror's concave surface took over four years. Its curvature, which was tested at regular intervals using polarized light rays, deviates less than one-millionth of an inch, making it the most accurate large mirror ever tested. C. A. Robert Lundin (center), Warner and Swasey's optical department director designed the machinery; he is pictured with an unidentified worker (left) and the company's late director of engineering E. P. Burrell.</description>
