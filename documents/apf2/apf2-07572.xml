  <description>[In 1869, the Illinois State Legislature established the South Park Commission and set aside over 1,000 acres of land south of Chicago in Hyde Park for local parks and boulevards which would connect to the city. The land was divided into eastern and western sections, and ultimately into Jackson and Washington Parks, and the Midway Plaisance. In 1893, the Plaisance was a part of the fair grounds of the 1893 World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition; afterward, it was incorporated into the re-established University of Chicago campus.]</description>
