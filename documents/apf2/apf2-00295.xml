  <description>The enlarged $4,000,000 American Bar Center, 1155 East 60th Street, Chicago, to be dedicated in ceremonies Tuesday, August 13. The size of the center has been doubled in the last three years, by construction of two new additions. The William Clarke Mason wing appears on the far right; the American Bar Foundation wing at the far left. Two additions were built at a cost of approximately $2,000,000. This photograph is a mosaic of 12 separate photos taken from that number of locations directly in front of the block-long Center.</description>
