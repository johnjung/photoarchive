  <description>[The University of Chicago Athletic Field was also called by its unofficial name, Marshall Field, after the famous Chicago retailer who donated the land in the early 1890s. In 1913, the site was officially renamed and dedicated Stagg Field, complete with a state-of-art football stadium designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge.
