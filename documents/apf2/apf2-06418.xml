  <description>[Photographic copy of a drawing of the new Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space Research of the Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies. Ground will be broken on the University of Chicago campus May 1, 1963, for one of the nation&rsquo;s first inter-disciplinary space research centers made possible by a $1,775,000 grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It will be located at 56th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Researchers in the new Laboratory will concentrate initially on theoretical and experimental astrophysics. There will be facilities for ground-based investigation and for developing satellite experiments in space. Heavily shielded subterranean facilities will permit analysis of low-level radioactivity in meteorites and extra-terrestrial materials. The training of space-oriented scientists will be part of the new laboratory&rsquo;s programs. The structure will adjoin buildings that form the complex of scientific resources that include the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Institute for Study of Metals, the Nuclear Accelerator Building, and the Institute for Computer Research.</description>
