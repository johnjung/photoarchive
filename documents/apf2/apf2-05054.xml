  <description>Astronomer Dr. Carl Keenan Seyfert looks through an eyepiece in the McDonald telescope while holding one of the control boxes, which are located at each observing point. These controls regulate the movements of the telescope and the shutter. Both the observatory, in the Davis Mountains of Western Texas, and its 82-inch reflecting telescope, the second largest in the world, were designed and built by the Warner and Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio for the University of Texas which will operate the facility with the University of Chicago. The observatory will be dedicated May 5, 1939.</description>
