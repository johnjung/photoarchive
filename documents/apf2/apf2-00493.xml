  <description>Partially assembled ring magnet octant undergoing alignment. Each of the magnet blocks is composed of half-inch sections of steel bonded together with fiberglass and epoxy resin. The blocks are bolted together and sealed. The gap in the magnet is for installation of the vacuum chamber, a stainless steel doughnut 5-3/4 inches high, 32 inches wide, and 200 feet in diameter. [The] man at right is using an optical alignment device. It is the relatively large size of this chamber which allows the ZGS to be a high intensity machine. More protons can be injected into the machine than in other machine because there is more space available from wall to wall of the chamber than in other machines. In the background is the radio-frequency cavity which accelerates the protons in the synchrotron. The frequency of this cavity is varied from 4 to 14 Megacycles per second as the protons pick up speed from 20,000 volt kick they receive each time they traverse the cavity. The beam enters the ring from the linac through the tunnel whose opening can be seen just to the right of the r. f. station.</description>
