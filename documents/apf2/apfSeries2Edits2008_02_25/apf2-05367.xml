  <description>[A Baptist school, the Old University of Chicago was established in 1856 on a ten-acre tract of land at 34th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue donated by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. In his memory, the university trustees named the main building Douglas Hall after its completion in 1859. The school was constantly plagued by financial difficulties and was forced to close in 1886.]</description>
