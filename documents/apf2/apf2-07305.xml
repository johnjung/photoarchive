  <description>University Settlement House and gymnasium with some of the public it serves. [In 1894, Mary McDowell, inspired by her experience at Hull House and contact with activists Jane Addams and Sophonisba Breckenridge, established the University of Chicago Settlement in a neighborhood near the stockyards. As director, she organized activities and services for immigrant families. Though privately run, it bore the name of the university, in part, because of support provided by faculty and students. The building was demolished during the urban renewal period in South Chicago of the mid-twentieth century.]</description>
