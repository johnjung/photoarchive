  <description>One of the nation's most powerful atom smashers, the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS), is shown nearing completion at the Argonne National Laboratory southwest of Chicago. This $47,000,000 facility is designed to produce greater numbers of accelerated particles than any other multi-billion volt atom smasher now in operation or under construction. Protons will be accelerated by the synchrotron to an energy of 12.5 billion volts before they are sent crashing into target atoms. The photograph also shows site preparation and grading for a center for high energy physics in the Middle West, to be constructed adjoining the ZGS at left. The building will house personnel of Argonne's High Energy Physics Division as well as some 135 visiting university professors and students. Work on the $6,900,000 structure began May 7. Construction is expected to be completed in August, 1963.</description>
