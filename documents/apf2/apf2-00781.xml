This picture shows the south front of the group of buildings, that face on the famous Midway of the World's Fair times. The clinics will provide 6,600,000 cubic feet of space, adding almost one-third to the building area of the University. Cost of the group, with equipment, was $5,000,000. The medical program of the University, which will make Chicago one of the leading medical centers of the world, involves a total of $20,000,000. Formal opening of the group will take place November 1,1927.</description>
