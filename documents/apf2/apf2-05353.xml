  <description>&quot;We present a very correct illustration of the University of Chicago. It is located in a block of ground donated for the purpose by the late Stephen Douglas, the present value of which is about $308,000. The building is constructed of a fine quality of limestone of a light shade, and for solidity and strength bids fair to stand the brunt of centuries of use. Its cost has been about $200,000.&quot;</description>
