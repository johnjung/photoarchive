  <description>Located at 60th Street between Kenwood and Kimbark Avenues, the University of Chicago's new Center for Continuing Education is nearing the final phase of construction. It will open in January, 1963 as a meeting place for world-renown scholars in a university setting to communicate the latest advances in knowledge to leaders in other fields. The $4,000,000 building faces the Midway Plaisance along the &quot;Cultural Mile&quot; of the campus. The three-story block-long building was made possible by a $2,333,333 grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of Battle Creek, Michigan.</description>
