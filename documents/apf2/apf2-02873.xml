  <description>Two hundred one prefabricated homes housing families of veterans who are students nestle in the University of Chicago's shadow. The houses are divided among three lots on 61 Street and Greenwood Avenue, 58th Street and Maryland Avenue, and 60th Street and Drexel Avenue. The two and three room units rent for $40 to $45 a month and were moved intact from war housing centers. Rent includes electricity, fuel for heating and cooking, and a garbage disposal service. Though veterans at present occupy only one-third of the homes, full occupancy is expected shortly.</description>
