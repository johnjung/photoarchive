  <description>Photograph taken during the final assembly of the 110-foot, 50 MeV linear accelerator (linac), the second stage of the injector system of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron. Protons are accelerated, from left to right in the picture, through 124 copper drift tubes, with gaps in between them inside a 34-inch vacuum cavity. The linac is a single resonant cavity powered by a large radio-frequency power supply, similar to a radar transmitter, capable of providing 5 million watt peak power. The electric field that accelerates the protons alternates the positive to negative at 200 megacycles per second. The protons pass through the drift tubes at precisely the time when this field is in the wrong direction for acceleration and emerge when the field is in the direction that will accelerate them. The first six drift tubes can be seen at the opening of the linac in the photograph. The design of both the Cockcroft-Walton generator and the linac is almost identical to that of the Brookhaven AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) system. In this way, a great deal of time was saved, and it was assured that the design was a good one because of the successful operation of the AGS.</description>
