  <description>Airplane view of the University of Chicago. The 1893 World's Fair encompassed the Midway, seen in the foreground. In thirty years, the university has emerged as fourth in the nation in terms of enrollment and endowment. A campaign is being launched to raise $17,500,000 this year and a total of $60,000,000 over the next fifteen years, with the goal of turning the university into one of the world's leading educational and research institutions.</description>
