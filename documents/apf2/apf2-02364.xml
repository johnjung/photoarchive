  <description>New Field House of the University of Chicago, located just north of Stagg Field, at University Avenue and 56th Street. The building is 368 feet long and 165 feet wide. The interior is a single great arena with no obstructions. The height from the clay floor to the centerline of the trusses is fifty feet. There is an eight lap to the mile track and a 100-yard straightaway. The basketball floor, 110 feet by 62 feet, near the east end, runs across the building, and does not obstruct the track. Removable bleachers give a seating capacity of 3,500. There is a locker room in the basement which provides accommodations for 500. The building is regarded as one of the most beautiful of its type in the country, its Gothic design, with an exterior of Indiana limestone harmonizing with the other University buildings. The architects are Holabird and Root.</description>
