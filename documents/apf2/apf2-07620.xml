  <description>The Chicago-Michigan game at the turn of the century. The spectator stands were wooden. Michigan-12, Chicago-0. [This game was part of an early tradition started by the University of Chicago and Michigan coaches, whereas these two rival teams would always meet for a Thanksgiving Day game. This tradition carried on until 1905, when, as a response to the increasing criticisms of the brutality of football, the National Football Committee instigated a number of reforms, which included the abolishment of Thanksgiving games. Shortly after the reforms were announced, the University of Michigan dropped out of the then Big Nine Conference and would not play another game with Chicago until after World War I.]</description>
