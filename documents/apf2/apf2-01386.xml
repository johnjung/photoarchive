  <description>[Photographic copy of a drawing of a] Burton-Judson Courts entrance (from 60th Street), the new residence halls for men at the University of Chicago. New dormitories for men and women, costing $3,000,000, are the first units of the university's development south of the Midway. On the north side of the Midway, the university front, known as the &quot;world's most beautiful academic avenue,&quot; now extends from Maryland Avenue to Blackstone Avenue, a distance of more than a mile and a quarter. The men's residence halls, now under construction, will be completed by October, and will house 400 students. The two units of the dormitory quadrangle are named for Drs. Harry Pratt Judson and Ernest DeWitt Burton, the university's second and third presidents.</description>
