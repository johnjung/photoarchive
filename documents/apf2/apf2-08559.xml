  <description>[Photographic copy of a drawing] of a recreation and general utility room in the University of Chicago's new $3,200,000 Residence Quadrangle for women students. Each of the three connecting residence halls in the quadrangle will have a recreation and hobby room for women students' leisure time use. All rooms will be equipped with card tables, a ping-pong table, ironing facilities, reading desks, and kitchenettes for preparation of between meal snacks. The residence quadrangle will house 516 women students in 60-single bedrooms and 228-double bedrooms. Each unit will have its own lounge to provide a social center for its residents, typing, and music practice rooms, and a guest room for visiting relatives. A common dining hall and central entrance unit will join the three four-story residence units. Designed by Eero Saarinen and Associates, the quadrangle will be constructed of Indiana limestone, and construction will be completed by September 1957 for the opening of the University's autumn quarter.</description>
