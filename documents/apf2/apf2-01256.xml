  <description>Nearly 500 alumni visited the new residence halls for men of the University of Chicago during the 1931 reunion. The halls, which opened in October and cost $1,700,000, provide living quarters for 390 men, libraries, clubrooms, dining halls, and a playing field. The dormitory group is important in the new educational plan at the University, for a selected group of faculty members living in the halls are available to help the students in their work.</description>
