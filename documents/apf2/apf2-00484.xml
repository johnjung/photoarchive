  <description>One of the first to visit the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) at Argonne National Laboratory after it achieved its full operating power of 12.5 billion electron volts was Illinois Governor Otto G. Kerner. Governor Kerner was one of the principle speakers September 26 at a Nuclear Applications Conference held at Argonne. A model of components of the ZGS was viewed by the Governor and his party during the visit. The model shows details of one of eight sections of a 4,800-ton magnet ring that guides protons around the ZGS as they are accelerated. From left to right, in the foreground, are Dr. Lee C. Teng, Director of Argonne's Particle Accelerator Division; Governor Kerner; Dr. Roger Hildebrand, Associate Director for High Energy Physics; and Dr. George W. Beadle, President of the University of Chicago. Others are members of the Governor's staff.</description>
