  <description>[Reproductive print copy of drawing.] When the present heating plant was completed in 1904, it furnished heat, light, and power to a small group of buildings. The addition of Harper Library, Rosenwald Hall, Ida Noyes Hall, and others increased the amount of space, which needed heat by 50 per cent. In 1912, 1914, and 1915 plant equipment was improved to meet the additional load. Between 1921 and 1923, eight new boilers replaced the original ones and the plant was expanded to maximum capacity. The heating of additional buildings is beyond the capacity of the present plant and the university proposes to construct a new one that will be capable of serving both present and future needs. In the proposed modern powerhouse, units will be housed one above the other to permit more efficient operation. A new plant and general service building is proposed to provide facilities for the storage of food and scientific materials, also, bakeries, laundries, incinerators, and other like apparatus. Two locations are being considered for this group of buildings, one at 58th Street and Harper Avenue, which would eliminate the cost of hauling coal, and a second just west of the present plant, which has the added advantage of being nearer to points of heat consumption. The final location will be determined based on the advice of consulting engineers. The heating plant group will cost between $2,000,000 and $2,500,000.</description>
