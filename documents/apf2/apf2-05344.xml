  <description>Formal dedication of Nuclear Energy, a major work by Henry Moore, one of Britain's leading sculptors, will take place on Saturday, December 2, 1967. The 12-foot bronze symbolic sculpture, created in England and cast in Germany, will be placed on the University of Chicago campus at the site of the now-demolished West Stands of Stagg Athletic Field. It was there on December 2, 1942 that the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction took place, an event directed by the late Nobel Prize winning physicist Enrico Fermi.</description>
