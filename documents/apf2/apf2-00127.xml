  <description>Schematic top view (north at bottom) shows how high speed protons are drawn from [the] University of Chicago's Synchrocyclotron and [are] directed to [an] underground experimental area seventy feet away. At right, protons are deflected from their circular course at [the] center of [the] atom smasher. As [the] protons emerge, they are formed into [a] beam by [the] first powerful magnet, and refocused into [a] fine beam by [the] second magnet.  A third smaller magnet directs the beam to [one] of two experimental areas in an underground target room. Speckled areas here indicate walls of [the] building.</description>
