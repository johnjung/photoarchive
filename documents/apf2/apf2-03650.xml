  <description>In the pathology department, the Autotechnicon is a great labor saver. Tissue specimens removed during surgery (biopsy) or obtained at autopsy are preserved in alcohol or formaldehyde. These are transferred, in sequence, to a series of solutions that remove water from tissue and allow it to be impregnated with paraffin or celloidin, depending on the type of microscopic section need. The Autotechnicon handles this job nicely and for the volume of work involved, one machine's output may be equivalent to that of three technicians.</description>
