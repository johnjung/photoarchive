  <description>New installation at the University of Chicago permits nuclear physics and biological experiments that were previously impossible. A beam of high-energy protons drawn from the heart of a powerful atom smasher is directed to remote experimental areas. [The] drawing (looking south) shows [the] university's 450 million-electron volt Synchrocyclotron in its Accelerator Building pit. Sandwiched between disk-shaped coils is [a] flat, nine-foot square vacuum chamber in which protons whirl at high speeds. Protons shot out of [the] front of this chamber are formed into a beam by the cylindrical magnet (lower left).</description>
