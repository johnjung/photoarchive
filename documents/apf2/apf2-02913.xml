  <noteGeneral>Attached to a cardboard back.Gift of Paul Scherer.  Two separate notes. The first reads: Bob: Mrs. Paul Scherer, who used to live here, has sent us the enclosed.  I can't believe that it will have much value, as vaguely identified as it is.  But maybe.  Anyway, it is better off in your care than ours.  And I don't think you're obligated to keep it if it's not a true addition to your collection. (signed) M. Beadle.  The second note reads: MMcF.  You can read Mrs. B's note.  I too think the whole thing is questionable-it doesn't look sandy enough and I guess that an ecologist could identify the trees and from this confirm whether it is lakeshore terrain.  You may be willing to do this but you might be willing to keep as a quasi-curiosity for future delving.</noteGeneral>
