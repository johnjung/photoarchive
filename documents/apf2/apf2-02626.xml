  <description>An aerial photograph showing the South Campus Project area proposed to the Chicago Land Clearance Commission by the University of Chicago July 19, 1960. Chicago's municipal authorities would receive a dividend of as much as $21,000,000 from Federal Renewal funds for use in slum clearance programs in other neighborhoods of the city if the University's plan were adopted. The 58.03 acres of South Campus (right), shown in the white strip, are bounded by Cottage Grove Avenue (800 East), 60th Street, Stony Island Avenue (1600 East), and 61st Street. The Midway Plaisance is in the center. The main university campus, including Stagg Field is to the left and the Museum of Science and Industry and Lake Michigan are to the east.</description>
