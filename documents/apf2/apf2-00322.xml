  <description>[Photographic copy of a drawing of the] U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's proposed Argonne Cancer Research Hospital. The hospital, operated for the Commission by the University of Chicago, will be located on campus (west side of Ellis Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets). Utilizing radioactive materials, it will function primarily to provide research treatment to cancer patients. The commission approved preliminary plans and specifications for the 50-bed hospital. It is estimated that the six-story structure will cost approximately $3,500,000 and will be ready for use by 1951. Schmidt, Gardner and Erikson of Chicago, Illinois is the architect-engineer firm.</description>
