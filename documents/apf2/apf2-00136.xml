  <description>A 2,000-ton magnet and two water-jacketed magnetic coils provide a magnetic pathway for [the] proton beam of the University of Chicago's 450-MeV (million electron volt) Synchrocyclotron. [A] thin vacuum chamber between [the] coils is where [the] beam is generated. Protons, basic particles in all atomic nuclei, are injected into [the] circular chamber's center by [the] ion source (here looking like a top hat). As the protons gyrate from the center along the spiral magnetic pathway, an electrical oscillator beats them to higher speeds. These have traveled 700 miles and are [moving] at top velocity, 75 percent the speed of light, when the outermost 170-inch wide track is reached. Targets to be bombarded by the proton beam are positioned in its path by a long probe, jutting here from the vacuum chamber to the right of the photograph.</description>
