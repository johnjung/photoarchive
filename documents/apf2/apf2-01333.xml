  <description>Midway front of the first unit of men's residence halls now under construction at the University of Chicago, to be completed September 15, 1931. This unit and another for women will cost $3,000,000, and are the first University of Chicago buildings south of the Midway. They are the start of a collegiate development in a new section of the quadrangles and bring the promise of the &quot;world's most beautiful academic avenue&quot; close to realization. Within a few years the old Midway Plaisance, home of the amusement sector of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 will be lined with the University's Gothic structures. The men's group is located on 60th Street, between Greenwood and Ellis Avenues. Mr. Julius Rosenwald, member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Chicago, and one of the University's leading benefactors, is contributing forty per cent of the costs. [Model by] Zantzinger, Borie and Medary, of Philadelphia, [the project's] architects.</description>
