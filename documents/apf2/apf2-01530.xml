  <description>As a student, Dr. Joseph B. DeLee studied maternity and home obstetric services in Berlin, Paris, and Vienna. He conceived the idea of a lying-in hospital in 1895 while studying medicine at Chicago's Cook County Hospital. In that same year, after receiving advice from Dr. Edmund J. Doering, he established his first dispensary at Maxwell Street and Newberry Avenue. The dispensary's first interns, Drs. Charles Lockwood and Charles Todd arrived on June 1, 1896. Thus began the march of young men and women through the institution. Many of these doctors have become respected leaders and specialists in obstetrics and have spread the gospel of good obstetrics and the reputation of the Chicago Lying-In Hospital around the world. The dispensary was relocated to a house on Ashland Boulevard in September 1899 and by 1927, the Lying-In Hospital's Board of Directors decided to affiliate with the University of Chicago in order to improve the level of the institution's teaching and research. Architects Schmidt, Garden and Erikson designed a new building on a site donated by the university. When opened in May 1931, Dr. DeLee said, &quot;We think it is the most beautiful hospital in the world, and it stands as a monument to childbearing women and to the dignity of obstetrics.&quot;</description>
