  <description>[A Baptist school, the Old University of Chicago was originally established as the University of Chicago in 1856 on a ten-acre tract of land at 34th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. Donated by Senator Stephen A. Douglas, the university trustees named the main building Douglas Hall in his memory after its completion in 1859. The school was constantly plagued by financial difficulties and was forced to close in 1886.]</description>
