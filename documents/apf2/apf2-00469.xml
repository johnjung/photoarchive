  <description>Aerial view of the site of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) at [the] Atomic Energy Commission's Argonne National Laboratory. A mound of earth, approximately 50 feet high, covers the doughnut-shaped ring building, which is 212 feet in diameter. Inside this building, within a 200-foot ring of steel magnets weighing a total of 4800 tons, tiny protons-the nuclei of hydrogen atoms-are accelerated to 12.5 billion electron volts. The protons and beams of secondary particles are shot into experimental buildings at the rear of the mound. In the foreground is the High Energy Physics Building where physicists who use the ZGS will have their offices and laboratories. Many of these physicists will come from Midwestern universities. Argonne National Laboratory is operated by the University of Chicago for the Atomic Energy Commission.</description>
