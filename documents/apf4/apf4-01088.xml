  <description>Also-ran makes big splash in NCAA Steeplechase. Joe Olive of the University of Chicago track team is shown clearing the first hurdle of a steeplechase race on four different occasions. The 3,000-meter event was part of the NCAA College Regionals at Stagg Field. Olive lands well past the hurdle on his first attempt, but his leap doesn't carry as far the next time around. Joe falters and nearly falls on his third trip and he gets thoroughly doused on his final effort.</description>
