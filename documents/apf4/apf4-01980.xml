  <description>Manual training wood shop in Belfield Hall, circa 1908. When the secondary schools constituting University High were brought together in 1901, the agreement stated that the Chicago Manual Training School should constitute the &quot;technical courses&quot; and enjoy a measure of independence in pursing its aims, clear thought, honest work, and willpower through work with one's hands. Industry put pressure on schools such as this to concentrate on vocational training, but Dean Henry Holmes Belfield, a Latin scholar, believed deeply in shop work and mechanical drawing as an important part of the college preparatory curriculum.</description>
