  <description>That Drum! Fifteen years ago Carl D. Greenleaf, president of C. C. Conn Ltd. and a prominent alumnus of the class of 1899 presented the University of Chicago with a set of 100 band instruments including a huge bass drum engraved with the university's coat of arms. To construct this gigantic instrument, which measures more that 8 feet in diameter, Mr. Greenleaf sent a representative to the Chicago stockyards to select the largest steers, and had the drum built around drumheads made from their hides. Mounted on a set of airplanes tires, six men are needed to handle it on the field.</description>
