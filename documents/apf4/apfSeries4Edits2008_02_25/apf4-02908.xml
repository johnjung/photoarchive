  <description>Typical of families occupying the compact houses are Mr. And Mrs. James R. Ahrens and their two children, Martha, 3, and Martin, 6 months. Ahrens, a law student at the university, was one of the first to become eligible for one of the homes because of his service record and previous enrollment. The family has one of the three-room units that include two bedrooms and a living room kitchenette.</description>
