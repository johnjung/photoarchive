  <description>That Drum! Fifteen years ago Carl D. Greenleaf, president of C. C. Conn Ltd. and a prominent alumnus of the class of &rsquo;99 presented the University of Chicago with a set of 100 band instruments engraved with the university's coat of arms. Included with the set was a huge bass drum built specially for the band. In building the drum, Mr. Greenleaf sent a representative to the Chicago stockyards with instructions to select the largest steers available from whose hides drumheads were made. The drum was built around these heads and measures more that 8 feet in diameter. It is mounted on a set of airplanes tires and takes six men to handle it on the field. On trips out of town a special car has to be secured from the railroad for the purpose of carrying it with the band. When the band appears in the Michigan stadium at Ann Arbor it is necessary to carry the drum over the top of the stadium to get it into the field, as no gate is large enough to accommodate it even off the carriage.</description>
