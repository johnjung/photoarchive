  <description>Dr. Harold O. Gulliksen, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Chicago working with a &ldquo;Lashley jumping apparatus&rdquo; for testing the learning behavior of white rats. The rat, placed on the platform in the foreground, has been taught to jump at either of the two doors on which the triangle symbols are placed. The door with the inverted triangle will not open, and if the rat jumps at this door, he will fall into a cloth bag placed beneath. If he jumps at the other door, he will pass through the opening and obtain the food behind the door. By shifting the symbols from side to side, Dr. Gulliksen can teach the rat to jump toward the proper symbol, regardless of the side on which he has placed it. In this picture, the rat jumps [in the wrong direction] and is falling into the bag.</description>
