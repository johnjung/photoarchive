However, all admitted that the annual senior mustache race conducted by the University of Chicago Blackfriars was no bristling success. You can see the winner Tom Turner, for yourself in this picture. His hirsute adornment was almost too sparse for the camera to register. The losers received a customary ducking in Botany pond; but so unsatisfactory was the downy &quot;crop&quot; produced by the winner that even he was given a dip.</description>
