  <description>Blind Organist works out on Rockefeller Chapel Organ. Frances Biery (left) 26-year-old, blind Dayton, Indiana organist, converses via Braille with Geraldine Lawhorn (right), a colored deaf and blind girl who called on Miss Biery as she was practicing on the Rockefeller chapel organ for a concert, Thursday, August 8 in the chapel. With Miss Biery is Bess, a Leader (as differentiated from Seeing Eye) dog; with Miss Lawhorn is Blondie, a pure white DeSalle (also differentiated from Seeing Eye) dog. Miss Biery, blind since she was ten, is currently writing a book on her school days at Dayton. Miss Lawhorn also intends to write. Her dog was purchased through gifts of schoolmates at Marshall High School and the local C[atholic]Y[outh] O[rganization] funds.</description>
