  <description>Midway students back Lease-Lend Bill and plan Aid-to-Allies Rally. Spurred by faculty members' disapproval of President Robert Hutchins' speech, in which he said the United States is drifting toward war and suicide, student leaders of the University of Chicago have pushed a &quot;Youth for Democracy&quot; drive and made plans for a huge Aid-to-the-Allies rally to be held at the university's Field House Tuesday night. While Roy Emery (right) signs a petition in support of the Lease-Lend bill, and Mimi Dayton (center) pins a &quot;Youth for Democracy&quot; button on Charles Johnson (left) as Edward Ullman (second from left) smiles approvingly.</description>
