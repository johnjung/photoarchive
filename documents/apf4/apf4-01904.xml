  <description>Novel form of education inaugurated at University of Chicago. Informal educational guidance is provided freshmen students at the university this season as part of the new &quot;gradeless&quot; and &quot;creditless&quot; system inaugurated by President Maynard Hutchins. The faculty and students occupy the same dormitories. Under the new system, which will be much observed by the academic world, the &quot;Freshies&quot; are their own bosses and every effort is made to make team-mates of the faculty and students. A student can work as swiftly or as slowly as he desires&mdash;he may attend classes or not&mdash;and may take examinations after any reasonable time. Here Professor Fred P. Millett, Associate Professor of English and Head Resident, is aiding freshmen in one of the new residence halls. Left to right, Kenneth Johnson, Professor Millett, Jerome Klonoek, Marvin Elkins, and Calvin Countryman.</description>
