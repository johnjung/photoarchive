  <description>With the approval of President Hutchins and the cooperation of all interested University authorities, Pontiac [Motor Cars] will present on Friday, January 29 the second in a series of radio broadcasts that should quickly become one of the outstanding programs of the air. The broadcast will be made directly from the Chicago campus and be transmitted over the entire NBC Red Network at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. You will hear the University Band, the Glee Club, and the cream of student vocal, instrumental, and dramatic talent in a program which, for pace, variety, and brilliance of production, will be second to none. If you tune in, we are certain you will not only be highly entertained by the quality of the program itself, but you will also thrill once more to the music, songs, and atmosphere of your student days. Michigan will be first in the series, January 22, followed at regular weekly intervals by Chicago, Ohio State, Columbia, and Pennsylvania. Pontiac is happy to sponsor the &quot;Varsity Show&quot; for two reasons: First, because it gives us an opportunity to be of some service to America's university graduates whose acceptance of Pontiac Sixes and Eights has been such an important factor in our success; and second, because we believe that the radio audience of America well be agreeably surprised at the talent available on the campuses of America.</description>
