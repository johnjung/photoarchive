  <description>First tried at Iowa State University at the suggestion of a resourceful student editor, the dry college nightclub has registered a hit with students at the University of Chicago. A threesome at one of the tables in the &quot;dry spot&quot; at Mandel Hall [is pictured] as they sip away at popular soft drinks. From left, they are: Alan Tully, Donna Culliton, and Jim Anderson. The boys' penchant for fun has reached the stage where they were attacking their drinks with mouthful of straws.</description>
