  <description>Flo Ziegfeld has his eye on the University of Chicago where he has located forty potential box-office magnets, but if, as you read this, you happen to be a co-ed at that Midway institution of learning, just calm yourself because America's most noted picker of pulchritude is gazing toward the other sex. He has his eye on the male Glee Club of forty zestful voices composed of &quot;the handsomest men that ever faced an audience.&quot; The Glee Club is scheduled to sing all week at the Tivoli Theater as headliners during the &quot;Campus Frolic Week.&quot; At a rehearsal several days ago, Ziegfeld talent scout Alphonse Soblier was an interested onlooker, and told Glee Club President Ralph Larsen that if the boys wanted to, he would place them in a feature position in the forthcoming Follies production, not as &quot;chorus men&quot; but as a group of trained artists. They are, according to Mr. Soblier, &quot;vocally perfect, and the greatest aggregation of sheiks ever assembled on any stage.&quot;</description>
