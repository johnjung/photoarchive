  <description>Weaving and textile class, circa 1904. As with most work done at the Lab Schools, the study of textiles involved the entire process from spinning to dyeing to weaving. History lessons were linked to the invention of the spinning jenny; geography was learned through the distribution of various fibers such as wool, cotton, and silk. Teachers&rsquo; reports were de rigueur, and [Dean Wilbur S.] Jackman often reported on results in &quot;The Elementary School Teacher,&quot; which he edited.</description>
