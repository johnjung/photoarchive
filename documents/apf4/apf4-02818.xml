  <description>Prom night (for those who did not attend the prom). Helene Cadmus, tall girl [standing] left of Ludin Quinlan [who is in the] first row with one leg [showing]. Copy of a note written to Muriel, Mrs. George W. Beadle January 9, 1974 after a dress rehearsal of the Faculty Wives&rsquo; Show, which this year was called &ldquo;The Women of Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar.&rdquo; Dear Muriel Beadle: The dress rehearsal last night was delightful and brought back memories of my undergraduate days in Foster Hall eating at Myra Reynolds's round table in the easy bay window, making our own French dressing at the table drop by drop, those charming Irish maids, the pantry where we could go for a snack of crackers and milk when we came in late at night, Sundays when we had supper sitting on the floor around the fireplace listening to Miss R. tell of her early experience at the U of C, the three weeks quarantine for scarlet fever in March of 1916 when we published &ldquo;The Fumigator&rdquo; and for exercise each day were escorted down the Midway to the lake and back, and the floors half a block apart! That was before the days of Dr. Dick&rsquo;s discoveries. Indoors, Miss Holliston held a class in pottery and we played the &quot;orchestrella,&quot; a fantastic machine that produced all the orchestra instruments much as a piano player does. I have often wondered what became of it. We too used to swing Indian clubs to music in Lexington Hall under Gertrude Dudley&rsquo;s direction. Sincerely, Faerie Engle (Mrs. Robert Engle who was Faerie Mallory).</description>
