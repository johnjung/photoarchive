  <description>When Professor James Henry Breasted left Chicago in February, bound for the Near East, he forgot to lock one of the doors of his new Oriental Museum. The alert cameraman has snapped three wandering members of Blackfriars in the act of hatching their 1933 show [titled], &quot;Gypped in Egypt,&quot; which [is about] Dr. Breasted's current adventures in the land of the Nile. With characteristic nonchalance, the Friars are drawing their inspiration from the Museum&rsquo;s Great Stone Bull, which happens to be Assyrian. The show will be produced in Mandel Hall May 12, 13, 19, and 20.</description>
