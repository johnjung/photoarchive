  <description>[On January 30, 1969, several hundred students occupied the Administration Building to protest the University&rsquo;s decision not to reappoint Marlene Dixon, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and Committee on Human Development. Administrators and staff evacuated their offices and continued their work in other University Buildings. On February 14, 1969, students voted to end their sit-in and leave the building. Following the sit-in, photographs were taken by the University administration to document the condition of the interior of the building. In March 1969 the University suspended eighty-one students involved in the sit-in, expelled forty-two, placed three on probation, and fined one for the cost of a broken window.]</description>
